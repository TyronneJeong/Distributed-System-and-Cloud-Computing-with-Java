welcome back everyone we now dashed upon every aspect and

layer of a typical distributed system and we can design and build a scalable

and reliable distributed system for any purpose so at this point the only thing

we're missing is the infrastructure to actually deploy our system on this

brings us to the cloud so in this lecture we'll get an introduction to

cloud computing we will learn what the cloud actually is and what benefits we

get by deploying our distributed system on the cloud infrastructure finally we

will learn how cloud services are organized and get familiar with a few

fundamental cloud computing building blocks so let's start with an

introduction to the cloud before cloud computing was available if

we wanted to deploy a distributed system to provide a service to our clients we

had only one option we had to buy or rent a server room and buy and set up

all the infrastructure ourselves or hire someone else to do it after making the

initial big investment and infrastructure we'd have to have

permanent staff to maintain and upgrade all those servers routers load balancers

and so on not too long ago all companies big or small had to do this and a few

large companies came to the conclusion that since everyone basically needs the

same building blocks to run their distributed systems infrastructure

should be treated as a utility similar to water or electricity in our homes so

Amazon Google and Microsoft after first creating internal api's for their

internal teams to access this infrastructure externalize those api's

in the form of cloud offering called infrastructure as a service in addition

to infrastructure as a service they also launched a lot of features in a form of

platform as a service that provides a higher level abstraction for developers

essentially those companies have made their compute power and internal

infrastructure available for us to rent on demand and by deploying our

distributed system on the cloud we are paying just for what we use thanks to

the cloud services we can get our startup up and running within minutes

without the need for large initial investments upfront so basically the

cloud vendors are focusing on the infrastructure while we can focus on our

business logic and our system design and everybody wins

today there are many cloud vendors offering hundreds of features with

easy-to-use user interfaces high quality documentation and rock-bottom prices

their products are constantly changing so we're going to cover just the

essential components that are offered by most cloud vendors though possibly by

different names and are enough to deploy a distributed system at any scale so

let's talk about the basic concepts and fundamental building blocks of cloud

computing every cloud vendor provides

infrastructure services in multiple regions these are physical geographical

regions all across the globe the different regions are completely

isolated from each other and that's by design as a client of one of the cloud

vendors we can employ our services in one or more regions each of those

regions has one or multiple data centers which are large buildings containing

thousands upon thousands of servers data replication and configuration

sharing between regions is limited and typically each region requires its own

configuration but this isolation actually provides the following benefits

first it provides fault tolerance and stability in case of a natural disaster

if one of the countries or regions is hit by a storm or an earthquake for

example and the entire region loses power or connection to the internet all

the other clients can fall back to our services in a different region having

our service in different geographical regions makes it easier to comply with

local rules and regulations some countries have different privacy

security and censorship laws than others some countries don't even allow storing

their users data in servers outside their borders so having slightly custom

logic in each region helps us provide comparable and compliant services based

on the geographical location another benefit is security isolation if one of

their regions is misconfigured has some kind of data corruption or is attacked

by hackers the other regions remain untouched finally if we distribute our

system globally we can provide everyone with low latency something we cannot

achieve if we deploy our system only in one location do the simple laws of

physics one thing to point out is data replication across regions is possible

however it usually incurs higher additional costs is typically slower and

more complex farther each region is broken down into

separate zones those zones are also completely isolated in terms of power

cooling and networking but are connected to each other within the same region by

a high-speed connection as a client running our distributed system on the

cloud we can deploy our servers or database instances in multiple zones to

provide high availability and fault tolerance within that particular region

a typical deployment can have multiple replicas of a database in different

zones and multiple instances of a service on servers in different zones

running behind a load balancer which typically also has multiple nodes in

each zone finally in each region we have many infrastructure building blocks that

we can launch within a few clicks of a button so let's talk about a few of them

one of the very basic services provided in each region are compute nodes

typically run in virtual machines coming in different sizes and configurations

just with those compute nodes we can already build our own distributed system

very easily and quickly by deploying the components we need on each node and

connecting them together another fundamental feature is out of scaling

which allows us to intelligently and automatically adjust our compute

capacity and maintain steady performance for us for the lowest cost at all times

using our scaling we will run and pay for just as many compute instances as we

need no more and no less to take advantage of our scaling we need

to set up triggers based on performance metrics like CPU usage memory

utilization or incoming traffic and the outer scaler will automatically add more

capacity when needed and reduce the capacity when possible to save us money

another fundamental building block is the load balancer the cloud load

balancer provides us with a unified IP for our service load balancing

capabilities failure detection and monitoring just like any load balancer

in addition to our ability to store our data on the compute nodes cloud vendors

also provide advanced proprietary storage solutions those range from ultra

cheap memory access storage tiers used primarily for long-term data backup to

high QPS low latency file storage for video audio and app data all providing

way above 99.9% availability and durability

for databases we have a variety of offerings for sequel databases no sequel

document stores and in-memory caption layers in addition to our ability to

deploy our own solutions which we can actually mix and match once our

distributed system is already deployed on a cloud we can take advantage of many

other general-purpose offerings like unified logging

monitoring alerting big data analytics and distributed queues

and finally we have the more specialized services like function as a service

which allows clients to deploy a small piece of code and save even more on

costs and maintenance machine learning api's and specialized hardware IOT

services for hardware oriented companies blockchain security and many many

additional services and features once we deploy our distributed system in

multiple data centers across the globe the cloud vendors also provide us with

domain name services and traffic management which allows us to register

our external service domain name and also route traffic to different regions

based on latency geo proximity or other criteria

so in the end all our users no matter where they are will see a unified view

of our system they will all have the same user experience and simply enjoy

using our product while remaining completely unaware of our systems

complexity and global distribution in this lecture we get a thorough

introduction to cloud computing will learn how clouds infrastructure and

platform as a service offerings can save us time and even money and remove the

entry barrier for young startups we also got an overview of the cloud

architecture and fundamental building blocks that are fairly Universal across

all cloud vendors now with our deep knowledge in distributed systems and

with the services provided by the cloud vendors we can easily design build and

deploy our distributed system for any purpose and scale see you guys all in
