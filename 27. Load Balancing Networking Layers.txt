welcome back to another lecture on load balancing in this lecture we will learn

about another important aspect of load balancing we'll talk about the different

networking layers on which the load balancers can operate to direct incoming

traffic to our distributed system since all the traffic to our system flows

through the load balancers there are typically two networking layers on which

the load balancer can inspect the traffic and route it to the application

servers the first layer of load balancing is the transport layer which

is also referred to in the industry as layer for load balancing the layer

number corresponds to the transport layer in the OSI networking model the

second layer of load balancing is the application layer which is also referred

to as layer 7 load balancing the OSI model is very similar to the

tcp/ip model we learned in a past lecture and networking but it breaks

down the networking stack in a higher granularity

when a load balancer is configured to operate on the transport layer it simply

forwards the TCP packets from the client to the back-end server according to one

of the load balancing strategies we discussed earlier this is the most low

overhead load balancing mode since the load balancer does not inspect the

content of the TCP packets beyond the first few to make the load balancing

decision in this mode the only part of the TCP

stream that the load balancer is concerned with is the source and

destination IP address and port present in the TCP header for every request from

the user to the load balancer the load balancer needs to replace the source

address with its own address and replace the destination address with the back

end servers address the load balancer decided to send a request for every TCP

packet that the server sends back the load balancer needs to replace the

source address with its own again and replace the destination IP and port back

to the user's IP in port this way the user never knows any details about the

actual server's address that handled its requests and we keep our distributed

system secure and completely transparent to the outside world

when the load balancer is configured to operate on the application layer it can

make my smarter routing decisions based on the HTTP message header and that's

because in this mode the load balancer is not only inspecting the TCP packets

but also the HTTP headers content in the application layer mode the load balancer

can route the request to a different set of servers based on the request URL the

type of the requested data HTTP method or even browser cookies

for example if we run a video streaming web-based service the general request to

load the website's text and images can be routed by the load balancer to the

general web server cluster when routing the request to this back-end cluster we

may choose a strategy like round-robin for balancing the load among the

individual servers later when a user wants to search for a particular movie

the load balancer would route the request to our search compute cluster

where we can maintain a different load balancing strategy such as the leased

connections for example and finally when the user sends a request to start

streaming the actual movie the load balancer may route the request or

dedicated video cluster for this cluster we may use a combination of the users

cookie and the source IP hash strategy to maintain a continuous connection

between the user and a particular server throughout the entire streaming session

in this lecture we'll learn about the two networking layer modes that the load

balancers can operate in the transport layer load balancing is the best choice

if we only want to do simple world balancing without any additional routing

logic or if we want to keep the load balancing overhead to the absolute

minimum the application layer load balancing allows us to make smarter and

more advanced decisions at the load balancer based on the HTTP headers

content for most distributed systems the overhead of the application layer load

balancing is not very significant so the application layer mode is typically the

preferred mode of operation since it allows us a lot more routing control

over the incoming traffic to our system see you guys soon in the next lecture
