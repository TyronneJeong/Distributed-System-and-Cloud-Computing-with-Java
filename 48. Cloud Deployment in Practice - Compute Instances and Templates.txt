welcome back now that we got a thorough introduction to cloud computing and its

general concepts it's time to learn how to deploy a distributed system on the

cloud in practice so in this lecture we will learn how to deploy an application

on cloud compute instances and automate the process using instance templates to

demonstrate and practice deployment on the cloud we're going to use Google

cloud platform as the cloud vendor in this and the next few lectures but

before we jump to the fun part I need to share a short legal disclaimer since at

the time of creating this course I'm also a full-time employee at Google I

need to make it clear that I do not represent Google by any means and this

content is not endorsed by Google everything we're going to learn in the

section is obviously my personal opinion and comes from my own experience the

only reason I chose Google cloud for the demonstrations is that I personally

found it easier to start with especially for beginners but any other cloud vendor

would be a fine choice and it all depends on your personal preference and

business requirements so now that we got that out of the way

let's go ahead and deploy our first application on the cloud

to practice deployment on the cloud I prepared a very simple web application

ahead of time the application will simply randomly pick one of my favorite

quotes by famous people and show it in the browser the port on which our app is

going to listen on will be passed to it in the command line or use port 8080 by

default so let's first test application locally and once the web server is

running let's go to our web browser and as we can see we got our quote of the

day and at the bottom we see the host name which is my personal computer and

each time we refresh the page we get a new quote in addition our app has the

status endpoint which we'll use for health checks later in the section now

let's go back to our IDE and build and package the application so we can deploy

it as an executable jar on a cloud compute visual machine now let's switch

back to the browser and go to our cloud vendors web page once logged in we

navigate to our console and open the menu where we can see all the offerings

from our cloud vendor the first thing we're going to do is upload our jar file

to a storage bucket so our compute VMs will have access to our app so first we

navigate to cloud storage and simply create a new bucket we will call our

bucket application bucket then we click continue to leave everything else by

default for now and finally after we click create our bucket is ready then we

upload our jar file by clicking upload files and choose our jar file which

contains our logic with all its dependencies once the upload is complete

our application is available on the cloud so let's navigate to compute

engine and choose VM instances that is where we can rent compute resources

where we can deploy our apps so let's create our first VM name it web

application instance now in the region drop-down we can choose the geographical

location where we can rent this VM we're going to leave it as US central one

which is in the state of Iowa on the right side that we have different zones

within that geo region which we'll leave as is as well for machine type we have

many chance to choose from but for our

purposes we will choose the cheapest and most basic micro instance which has only

one CPU on and about half a gig of memory in the next part we can choose

what operating system we want to boot from what applications we want to be

pre-installed on our VM as well as the type and size of our disk here we're

also going to stick with the default as we don't need anything special finally

and most importantly in the firewall section we're going to allow HTTP

traffic coming in so we can access our applications front-end and that's it

once the status of the instance becomes green we can click on the SSH button and

open an SSH session browser window

once connected to our VM we see that actually Java is not installed yet so we

will run a command to update the current repositories and finally installed the

latest open JDK on this VM the installation process can take a few

minutes which we should take note of since this is the time it will take each

of our instances to boot and be ready to serve our app once we are done our VM is

ready to run our application so first we need to copy our jar file from our

storage application packet to the current VM which we will do by running

the GS utils copy command which is a Google Cloud tool to access its cloud

storage and finally it will launch our application listening on port 80 to test

our application we copy the compute instance IP address into another window

and here we go our application is now deployed on a cloud instance at the

bottom we see that it is indeed running on the web application instance host and

it is now able to serve content to anyone in the public Internet now if we

go back to our console and click on the VM instance and go to monitoring we can

see graphs that show us our VM CPU usage network usage and disk i/o and finally

once we're done with our VM we can either stop it temporarily or delete it

forever

successfully deployed our web application on the cloud we want to take

it one step further obviously repeating all the installation

steps manually for every instance is time-consuming and error-prone and would

not allow us to scale our system to hundreds or thousands of PM's and

services so we would like to do it successfully once and create a template

out of it to repeat it consistently as many times as we want for that we create

the instance template so let's navigate to the instance

template tab and click on create new template let's give our template a name

choose the same type of machine with it before leave the same operating system

and configure the firewall to allow HTTP requests but now in addition we're also

going to provide all the commands we type manually as a single startup script

so now every compute instance we create from this template will run the script

at boot time which will install Java bring in our applications jar and

started listening on port 80 notice that when creating this template

we don't have to specify the region since we can reuse this template to

launch compute instances anywhere we want so let's create a template and now

once the template is ready we can simply click on create VM or all we need to do

is just give it a name choose the region and zone which we'll leave as is and

click create to launch the VM once the VM is done booting we can copy its

address to another browser window and find a new instance of our application

running one thing to point out is that it may actually take a few minutes for

the instance to become available depending on the time it takes to

execute all the startup scripts provided in a template in my case it actually

took about five minutes so exercise patience if you can't open the web page

right away and finally once we're done with this VM we can also go ahead and

delete it to make sure we don't get built for running the VM when we don't

actually need it in this lecture we deployed our first

application on the cloud we'll learn how to store our application and optionally

any additional resources it means on cloud storage then we'll learn how to

create virtual machine instances and rent compute resources in remote

geographical locations where we want our service to be available next we'll learn

how to connect bootstrap and launch our application to be publicly available to

any users on the public Internet and finally we automated our deployment

process using instance templates and a custom startup script to eliminate any

errors and also take one step closer to a full distributed system deployment

thank you and I will see you in the next lecture
